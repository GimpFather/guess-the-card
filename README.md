# 🎴 Guess the Card

A fun, emoji-based guessing game built for the Hearthstone community and streamer **[Rarran](https://www.youtube.com/c/Rarran)**.  
Made just for fun — and also as an excuse to play around with **Cursor** IDE.  
Btw. I'm more design person than logical so it was a little bit challaning!

## 🧩 Gameplay

You're shown a set of emojis that symbolically hint at a Hearthstone card.  
Your task? Guess the card name based on those clues.

There’s no timer, no rush. Just pure guessing fun.  
Use hints if you get stuck — they’re free.

Your progress is saved in your browser (local storage), and you can reset it anytime.
